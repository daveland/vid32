My first github project.  Begun 1/9/2010
This Project impliments a 32Bit video game on 2 chips.  the ATUC32B0256 CPU 
and the aD738 Video Generator Chip.

Software does all the timing for video generation.  so Most of the CPu power (60 Mips)
Is used to send pixels to the screen.  You get 1-2 mips of leftover cpu power during
the vertical blanking interval to run your game.  The concept is very similar to the 
UZEBOX  that uses the ATmel AVR 644.  Thanks for the inspiration!!

Status 1/9/2010
This generates 320X240 Video using 8*8 tiles.  The tile memory is in RAM for SPeed of
access.  I currently have video timig working but it needs more cycle counting.  There
is A PCB Layout available.  I'll add a picture of the board and a schematic later on.
Perhaps a couple of screenshots.  Not games yet.  I'm looking for game code volunteers!!
The code is messy since this is my first AVR32 project.  I'm getting the hang of the
atmel toolchain.  I need to add more comments and design info.  Perhaps a web page 
as well.
